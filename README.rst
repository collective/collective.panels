Overview
========

This add-on extends Plone with "portlet panels".

Panel sets can be added above or below page contents; each embody a
portlet manager and the assigned portlets are rendered according to a
selected layout.

The default layout simply floats the assigned portlets, up to four in
a row using Plone's "Deco 16" grid.
